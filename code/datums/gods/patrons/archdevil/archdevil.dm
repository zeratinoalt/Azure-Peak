	//You have to draw power from unstable magicka, corrupted with your own essence to make a pale imitation of that divine spark - that is to say, you get custom magic on classes.
	//Yes, a pale imitation. You don't pray, you don't gather, your spells will be detrimental to everyone that isn't you one way or another.
	//Its also why your incantations are fucked up, these are essentally a bastardisation of several things into something that shouldn't exist.
