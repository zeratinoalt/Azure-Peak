// Originally, we had a system from Vanderlin with an individual specific Favorite Food and Drink, but it was at once, too broad and too narrow. Hated Food / Drink is a cherry on top and mechanically didn't matter, and favorite food / drink without quality gating is extremely narrow and leans you toward 1 or 3 powergaming options optimistically. The new one gate you to favorite cuisine, favorite dish type and favorite drinks - positive only.

// Cuisines are designed to not be broad universal catch all, so North Imperial (Grenzelhoftian) has a lot of pies and bread and land food, whereas South Imperial exclude most pies but includes seafood and some foreign and elven fare. Northern is Hammerhold + Gronn. Southeastern is Kazengun / Gronn.
