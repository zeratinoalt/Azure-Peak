	The murmurs within the crowd grow loud and obnoxious, echoing in your skull. \
	Yet, you persist. One of the faithful isn't so easily swayed by a little bit of nausea. \
	Perhaps it was that morning's porridge. It wouldn't be the first time the rot of the land afflicted the golden grains. \
	The sermon proceeds. You dilligently sing your portion of her holy hymns. \
	It just.. Drags on. The words stuck to your tongue like sludge. \
	Musing such thoughts left you ill-prepared for the sudden drop of moisture hitting your forehead. \
	You rub out the drop, not even singing anymore. The roof? But- it isn't even raining. \
	Sensing the disturbance, you are excused. Acolytes file to fill the gap you've left. \
	Stumbling over to the staircase. But you do not reach it, your legs do not follow commands any longer. \
	Gazing up the walls start to lengthen, and where the roof should be, there lies the eye of the storm instead. \
	The congregation doesn't seem to notice, only your form is getting soaked in the ever swelling deluge. \
	The lock in your knees lifts, but the realm buckles under each step. \
	I am awake, yet I dream. My eyes weep with otherworldly tears. \
	But it all pales in comparison to the hatred. \
	Anger, levied at the way the realm is shaped. \
	Pillars should wave, they shouldn't rise up as straight monuments. \
	They shouldn't be singing of Her, they should be telling His great deeds. \

	But one among them hesitates. A young acolyte, their hand clasped around a coral pendant. \
	They turn, and for a moment, their gaze meets mine across the span of dream and waking. \
	'It's not Abyssor,' they whisper. 'Something else wears His voice. \
	Something that learned His songs from the echoes.' \
	The sea erupts. A shape rises. Not the Deepfather, but a mockery of Him. A creature of borrowed flesh \
	and stolen divinity, its form a grotesque patchwork of the faithful it has claimed. \
	The acolyte runs, and I follow. But the dream frays at the edges, and I feel the pull of waking. \
